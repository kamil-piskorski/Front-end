# Front-end

Welcome to my repository dedicated to the Front-end Master challenges! This is a space where I documented my progress learning front-end technologies, especially HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are some challenges that I completed, hoping that they would teach me to be a better web developer.

I chose a path in data analytics, but I think it's nice to leave some legacy behind!
